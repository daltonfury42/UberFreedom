# UberFreedom
## Description

UberFreedom does not use any Google framework libraries, or Uber APIs. It only parses the mobile website in order to gain the information it needs. Therefore this app can be used on devices without Google Services installed. Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe">NewPipe</a>, an amazing YouTube player for Android.
